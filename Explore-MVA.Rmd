What are the values from MVA Category?  Some label are difficult to read on the map.

```{r}
unique(kcmo_mva_sf$clstr_fina)
```

For example, Top Categories are A, B, C.  Bottom Categories are G, H, I.

```{r}

## Median sales price

# summary(kcmo_mva_sf$mspn_lb_14)

#### Variation sales price 
... of residential properties sold between 2014 and 2016q2

How is percent represented? 0.5 would typically be 50%. Most under 50% variation in sales price, but also 1.0, 1.5. 2.0 (variation = 2x 200% ??)

*Hmmm, there is a wide range in variation in the sales price of residential properties.*

```{r}
# summary(kcmo_mva_sf$vspn_lb_14)
   #   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
   # 0.0000  0.3030  0.4505  0.5599  0.7351  2.2277

## Percentage of residential parcels with a new construction permit
... issued between 2014 and 2015

This variable seems to be a good indication of areas of growth, new development ...

The vast majority of KC has little if any new construction (3rd quartile < 0.2% (2/10th of 1%)).  The map below filters out block groups with < 1% so it is easier to see areas where there is new construction (1% to max. of almost 50%) 

```{r}
# summary(kcmo_mva_sf$pncnst_121)
  #     Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
  # 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.014647 0.002604 0.497207 

kcmo_mva_sf %>% 
   filter(pncnst_121 >= 0.01) %>%                    # > 1% of parcels
  
tm_shape(bbox=kcmo_mva_sf) +
  tm_polygons(col="pncnst_121", title="% New Const. Permit", palette="GnBu",
              #n=10,
              legend.hist=TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE)
```

## Percent of residential properties with permits for new construction or improvements
... valued over $1k, excluding demolitions

Two areas > 1.0 (or > 100% of residential properties). Data error?

Below displays block groups in the top quartile - where > 6.78% of residential properties have permits for new construction or improvement over $1K.

```{r}
# summary(kcmo_mva_sf$pperm_1_k_)
  #    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  # 0.00000 0.02558 0.03761 0.06824 0.06775 1.57143

boxplot(kcmo_mva_sf$pperm_1_k_, horizontal=TRUE)

kcmo_mva_sf %>% 
   filter(pperm_1_k_ > 0.06775) %>%                    # Top Quartile
tm_shape(bbox=kcmo_mva_sf) +
  tm_polygons(col="pperm_1_k_", title="% $1k+ Improvement", palette="GnBu",
              n=10,
              legend.hist=TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```

## Households per acre

High density areas are Downtown, Crown Center (?Westport), the Plaza.

The map below displays the top quartile - block groups with the highest households per acre.  For reference, an acre is about 3/4 of a football field.  The 3rd quartile is 6.7 hh/acre, so 75% of the census block groups are < 7 households per acre.

```{r}
# summary(kcmo_mva_sf$hhdense)
  #  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  # 0.000   2.882   4.435   7.959   6.784 182.855 

tmap_mode("view")

  kcmo_mva_sf %>% 
    filter(hhdense > 7) %>%                    # most dense 25%
  tm_shape(bbox=kcmo_mva_sf) +
    tm_polygons(col="hhdense", title="HH / acre", palette="GnBu",
                n=10,
                alpha=0.5,
                legend.hist=TRUE) +
    tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
  
tmap_mode("plot")
```

## Percent of Households that are owner occupied

So ... Own vs. Rent??

Interesting, this is the first variable with a more even distribution throughout the city (vs. highly skewed)

```{r}
#summary(kcmo_mva_sf$phuoo)
 #   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 # 0.0000  0.3516  0.5658  0.5533  0.7932  1.0000 

tm_shape(kcmo_mva_sf) +
  tm_polygons(col="phuoo", title="% Owner Occupied", palette="GnBu",
              #n=10,
              legend.hist=TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```

## Percent of residential properties with maintenance violations issued in 2014 and 2015

Might want to target areas with low violation < 75%

The map below displays the top quartile - block groups with the highest % of maintenance violations (> 19%).

```{r}
#summary(kcmo_mva_sf$pmviol_141)
  #    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  # 0.00000 0.05556 0.12230 0.13461 0.19559 0.53778 

kcmo_mva_sf %>% 
  filter(pmviol_141 > 0.196) %>%                    # top 25%
tm_shape(bbox=kcmo_mva_sf) +
  tm_polygons(col="pmviol_141", title="% Maintenance Violation", palette="GnBu",
              #n=10,
              legend.hist=TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```

## Percent of residential properties on the vacant property registry,
... owned by a bank, with a vacant property violation, on the city's dangerous buildings list, or with a demolition permit issued in 2014 or 2015*

What's up with northern most block group?  It had a lot of new construction - so is a lot still owned by a bank, vacant (not sold to homeowner yet), or had some kind of demolition permit prior to new construction??

```{r}
#summary(kcmo_mva_sf$pvac_any_1)
  #     Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
  # 0.000000 0.008602 0.029963 0.071619 0.093313 0.553684 

kcmo_mva_sf %>%
   filter(pvac_any_1 > 0.10) %>%                    # > 10%
tm_shape(bbox=kcmo_mva_sf) +
  tm_polygons(col="pvac_any_1", title="% Vacant", palette="GnBu",
              #n=10,
              legend.hist=TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```

# Explore Data Structure

Documentation mentions "split" blocks.  The MVA was generally at the level of Census Block Groups but a couple groups were split.
```{r}
nrow(kcmo_mva_sf)

# Yes, geo id is unique - split block groups have letter appended to the end.
nrow(kcmo_mva_sf %>% 
  group_by(geo_id) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(n == 1))
```

FYI: Where are the split blocks?

```{r}
kcmo_mva_sf %>% 
  filter(split == 1) %>% 

tm_shape(bbox=kcmo_mva_sf) +
  tm_polygons(col="pink") +
  
  tm_shape(kcmo_mva_sf) +
    tm_borders()
```
