Geomarketing Analysis in Kansas City, Missouri

A business owner has hired you to help him identify potential locations to build a new gas station. Here are his requirements:
1.	He would prefer it to be in Kansas City, Missouri since he already has business interests there.
2.	He wants an area that has potential for population growth and/or foot traffic.
3.	He wants to know median incomes for proposed areas.
4.	He also wants to know his potential competitors for proposed areas.

Use the provided data sources and the client’s requirements to come up with at least three block groups that the client should research further to find potential sites for a gas station.
