# Explore Variables

I captured information on variables available in the 2014-2018 5-year ACS and saved it as a .csv file.  I manually scanned the info and selected some relevant attributes.

```{r}
# v18_acs5 <- load_variables(2018, "acs5", cache = TRUE)
# # write.csv(v18_acs5, file="Data/vars2018_ACS5.csv", row.names=FALSE)


# v18_acs5_concepts <- as.data.frame(unique(v18_acs5$concept))
# colnames(v18_acs5_concepts) = c("concept")
# 
# v18_acs5_concepts %>% 
#   filter(str_detect(concept, "TRANSPORTATION"))
# 
# v18_acs5 %>% 
#   filter(concept == "MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION TO WORK")
```

Ideally, gather data by Census Block Group to match the KC MVA study, but consider Census Tract (larger, several Block Groups) if relevant data is not available.

Note:  Kansas City stretches across portion of Jackson, Clay, Platte counties.  I will need to gather data for multiple counties and toss the tracts/block groups outside the boundary of the KC MVA study.

# Gather Data at Census Block Group Level

### Couple of Quick Map

**Median Income (Est & Measure of Est. (MOE)) by Block Groups across the 3 counties**
```{r}
tm_shape(co_blkgrp_vars) +
  tm_polygons(col  =c("median_incomeE", "median_incomeM"), 
              title=c("Est",            "MOE"),
              palette="Greens") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Median Income", legend.position = c("left", "bottom"))
```

**Percent of Fuel Vehicles as the Means of Transportation to Work**
Fueled Vehicles include Car/Truck/Van, Motorcycle and Taxi (TBD), but exclude Public Transportation, Walking or Bicycle.

```{r}
co_blkgrp_vars %>% 
  mutate(towork_fuel = (towrk_carE + towrk_taxiE + towrk_mcycleE)/towrk_totalE) %>% 
  tm_shape() +
    tm_polygons(col   = "towork_fuel",
                title = "Percent") +
    tm_layout(main.title = "Fueled Vehicle to Work", legend.position = c("left", "bottom"))
```
